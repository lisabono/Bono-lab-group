abstract: Phages are viruses that specifically infect bacteria, and their biodiversity contributes to historical and current development of phage therapy to treat myriad bacterial infections. Phage therapy holds promise as an alternative to failing chemical antibiotics, but there are benefits and costs of this technology. Here, we review the rich history of phage therapy, highlighting reasons (often political) why it was widely rejected by Western medicine until recently. One longstanding idea involves mixing different phages together in cocktails, to increase the probability of killing target pathogenic bacteria without pre-screening for phage susceptibility. By challenging 30 lytic phages to infect 14 strains of the bacteria *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, we showed that some phages were “generalists” with broad host-ranges, emphasizing that extreme host-specificity of phages was not necessarily a liability. Using a “greedy algorithm” analysis, we identified the best cocktail mixture of phages to achieve broad bacteria killing. Additionally, we review how virus host-range can evolve and connect lessons learned from virus emergence—including contributions of elevated virus mutation rates in promoting emergence and virus evolutionary transitions from specialized to generalized host-use—as cautionary tales for avoiding risk of “off-target” phage emergence on commensal bacteria in microbiomes. Throughout, we highlight how fundamental understanding of virus ecology and evolution is vital for developing phage therapy; heeding these principles should help in designing therapeutic strategies that do not recapitulate consequences of virus selection to emerge on novel hosts.
