Lisa Bono is an assistant professor of Biological Sciences at Texas Tech University. She is broadly interested in the ecology and evolution of viruses. She primarily uses an experimental evolution approach to study how ecological interactions can drive host range expansion in the bacteriophage (bacteria-infecting virus) phi6, which infects the plant pathogen _Pseudomonas syringae_ and related pseudomonads. Additionally, she studies how a changing host landscape impact a virus' ability to adapt to novel situations in the future and how social interactions impact a virus' fitness. When not in the lab, she enjoys virus hunting for phages.
